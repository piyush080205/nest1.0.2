## Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be configured in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY=your_razorpay_key
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Important**: Replace placeholder values with real credentials before production deployment. The app gracefully falls back to demo mode when credentials are not configured.

## Getting Started

### Development
The development server is configured to run on port 5000:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at the configured domain (port 5000)

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Key Features Details

### Secure Payment Flow
1. User selects a tour package and views details
2. Clicks "Book This Package" button
3. Fills in booking form with traveler details:
   - Full name (minimum 2 characters)
   - Email address (validated format)
   - Phone number (exactly 10 digits)
   - Number of travelers (1-15, integer validated)
   - Travel date
   - Special requests (optional)
4. System calculates total amount client-side for display
5. User proceeds to payment
6. **Server validates all inputs** before creating order
7. **Server recalculates amount** from package price × travelers (never trusts client)
8. Razorpay order created with server-calculated amount
9. User completes payment through Razorpay checkout
10. **Server verifies payment signature** using HMAC SHA256
11. Booking confirmed only after successful verification

### Security Implementation (Architect-Approved)
- **Server-Side Validation**: All inputs validated before processing
  - Package ID validated against database
  - Number of travelers: integer 1-15 only
  - Email, phone, name format validation
- **Amount Protection**: Server recalculates amount from source data
  - Package price looked up server-side
  - Client amount validated but never used
  - Rejects mismatched amounts with logging
- **Payment Verification**: Cryptographic signature verification server-side
- **Tamper Detection**: Logs all suspicious attempts with timestamps
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers prevent all known attack vectors

### Package Filtering
- Search by keywords (destination, activity, location)
- Filter by state (all 8 NE states)
- Filter by category (Adventure, Wildlife, Cultural, Trekking, Heritage)
- Real-time filtering with instant results

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized navigation with hamburger menu
- Card-based layout adapts to all screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Gradient hero section with overlay text
- Grid layouts for packages (1-3 columns based on screen size)

## API Routes
- `/api/create-order` - POST endpoint for creating validated Razorpay payment orders
- `/api/verify-payment` - POST endpoint for verifying Razorpay payment signatures

## Development Notes
- Uses Next.js 14 App Router for improved performance
- Implements Server Components where possible for better SEO
- Client components used for interactivity (forms, modals, toast notifications)
- Tour packages data structure allows easy database migration
- Follows TypeScript best practices with comprehensive typing
- Accessible design with proper semantic HTML
- ES Module configuration (postcss.config.cjs, next.config.mjs)
- Workflow configured for port 5000 with 0.0.0.0 binding
